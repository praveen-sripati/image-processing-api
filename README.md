# Image Processing API

This project aims to provide a real-world scenario in which you would read and write to your disk via a Node.js express server rather than a database. The project serves two purposes: to prepare for setting up scalable code and architecture for real-world projects and tie together some of the most popular middleware and utilities found in Node.js projects.
